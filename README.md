# Leaderboard for SETU Karting Club

This is a React app to display a simple leaderboard whhich automatically adds student into their categories. I hope for this app to evolve into a full fledged app with a database and a login system. An admin could log in and add students to the databse and update their times.

## Target Features

-   Leaderboard split into 3 categories
-   Authentication to allow certain users to update leaderboards
-   NodeJS and Express for backend
-   MongoDB database to store students and their times
